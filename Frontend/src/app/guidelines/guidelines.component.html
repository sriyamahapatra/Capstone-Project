    <h1>Forest Community Guidelines</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Last Updated: November 2, 2025</p>
  </div>

  <div class="introduction">
    <p>Forest is designed to be a thriving network of unique communities, powered by connection, discussion, and authentic user-generated content. These communities are only as strong, safe, and legitimate as we make them together.</p>
    <p>While your community's moderators set specific rules for their corner of Forest, the following are the <strong>Platform-Wide Rules</strong> that apply to everyone, everywhere on Forest. We ask that you abide by not just the letter of these rules, but the spirit as well.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rules-section">
    <h2>Rules of the Forest</h2>

    <div class="rule-card">
      <h3>Rule 1: Remember the Human (Zero Tolerance for Hate and Harassment)</h3>
      <p>Forest is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking or diminishing others.</p>
      <p>Everyone has a right to use Forest free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence.</p>
      <p>Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity, vulnerability, or protected groups will be <strong>immediately and permanently banned</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-card">
      <h3>Rule 2: Keep it Legal and Legitimate</h3>
      <p>Do not post illegal content, and do not solicit or facilitate illegal or prohibited transactions. This includes, but is not limited to, the promotion of fraud, illegal drugs, or pirated media.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-card">
      <h3>Rule 3: No Sexual, Abusive, or Aggressive Content</h3>
      <p>We strictly enforce a ban on high-risk harmful content.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A-Content:</strong> Do not post or encourage the sharing of abusive or aggressively violent content.</li>
        <li><strong>P-Content:</strong> Never post or threaten to post intimate, sexually-explicit, or suggestive content of someone without their consent. Any pornographic content is prohibited.</li>
        <li><strong>Minors:</strong> Do not share or encourage the sharing of any sexual, abusive, or suggestive content involving minors. Any predatory behavior toward minors is strictly prohibited and will be reported to law enforcement.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-card">
      <h3>Rule 4: Respect Privacy and Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>Instigating harassment, for example by revealing someone’s personal or confidential information (doxxing), is not allowed. Be mindful of the personal data you share and the data of others.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-card">
      <h3>Rule 5: Participate Authentically</h3>
      <p>Engage in communities where you have a genuine personal interest.</p>
      <p>Do not spam or engage in disruptive behaviors (including mass content manipulation) that interfere with other communities on Forest.</p>
      <p>Do not intentionally mislead others or impersonate an individual or entity in a deceptive manner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-card">
      <h3>Rule 6: Abide by Community Rules and Moderation</h3>
      <p>The culture of each community is shaped by its dedicated moderators. You must abide by the specific rules of the communities in which you participate and do not interfere with the moderation or function of communities in which you are not a member.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="rule-card">
      <h3>Rule 7: Don't Break the Site</h3>
      <p>Do not attempt to break, exploit, or interfere with the normal, intended use of the Forest platform or its underlying infrastructure.</p>
